# Contributions to ZUM projects

If you'd like to contribute to Znanstvenik u meni projects, we'd be glad to have you on board!

## Reporting issues, suggesting features and testing applications and infrastructure

This is by far the easiest way to contribute to our open source projects: if you encounter an issue while using our apps or website, open an issue on GitHub or let us know by email.

We accept issues for:
 * the competition management and application submission software in znanstvenikumeni/competitionmanager
 * the video management and streaming services (transcoding, player generation etc) in znanstvenikumeni/vmss
 * the website itself in znanstvenikumeni/web
 
 Issues can be about:
  * bugs you encounter while using our websites and services
  * bugs you encounter while trying to run our services locally
  * UX/UI inconsistencies you find while using or running our services locally
  * missing features and feature requests
 
 If you're not sure if you should open an issue or not, your best bet is to open one.
  
 However, as all of these systems work together and sometimes it's hard to tell which one is having problems, you can open an issue in the repository you think fits the best. If it's actually a problem with a different service, that's not a problem :)
 
 Testing applications for UI and UX reasons is also a great help!
 
 ## Development
 
 Feel free to work on development in our services. We'll gladly accept pull requests for open issues and - depending if we need that feature or not - new features.
 
 If you're not sure whether we'll accept a pull request, feel free to open an issue to ask or contact us via email.
 
 ## Improving docs
 
 Documenting software can be challenging, and we'd be glad if you helped.
 
 Feel free to improve our documentation using docblocks or the wiki - we'll accept most pull requests that improve documentation.
 
 ## Need help?
 
 Some of our services (such as competitionmanager) are built for very specific usecases and have a lot of external dependencies, while others should be able to run basically anywhere (such as vmss).
 
 This means that some of our services have additional overhead for local development and external usage, which we are working on improving. 
 
 In the meantime, if you need help with setting up our projects locally and/or contributing to them, feel completely free to email @mbmjertan (who handles contributors to all ZUM projects - software or not) at mbm@znanstvenikumeni.org
 
 ## Contributing to non-software projects
 
 We'd be glad if you helped in project organisation in any way you can! If you're interested in that, feel free to email @mbmjertan at mbm@znanstvenikumeni.org.
 
 ## Code of conduct
 
We're not a large open source project, so a large CoC isn't necessary at this point. However, our contributor code of conduct can be summed up into three words: just be nice.

All the best,

the team behind @znanstvenikumeni
